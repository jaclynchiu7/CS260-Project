# AI-powered Ad Creatives Generation and Campaign with Hydroflasks

Generating product advertisements for companies is an inefficient and difficult process to implement manually. The goal is to provide insights into whether AI can generate advertisements while still preserving the quality and purpose of the product. For our AI model, we chose DreamBooth, a diffusion-based text-to-image generation model that utilizes stable diffusion 1.5, to generate personalized images based on unique identifiers (hydroflasks). We then conducted a survey using a mix of AI-generated output images and real images to evaluate the quality of generated images.
